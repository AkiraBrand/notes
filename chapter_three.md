- files in python are called modules.(THIS IS DIFFERENT FROM A RUBY MODULE)
- playground.py is a module.  wsgi.py is a module. etc, etc.
- all code is executed top to bottom each time it is run
- every file that ends in .py is a module
- import operations let you load that file and give you access to its content
- w/ large programs, one module is the main/top-level file, and this is the one that is launched to start the whole program
- you can only import something once per session even if you change the source file; because its expensive to import something
- you can overwrite this using the imp library and reload function w/o killing your session. Also it will be different if you changed your source file
- import is a statement, doesnt need parens.
- functions are called, and as such, need parens
