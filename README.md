# notes

This respository is for me to keep my notes organized and searchable as I learn Python. I also will push sections of my playground.py file, as to keep exercises organized as I code the books I read. 

Right now, I am currently reading O'Reilly "Learning Python, 5th Edition". http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920028154.do
 
 I am also working on two projects; building a web app from scratch through a WSGI Server, and a command line app to recognize user input and engage them in a small game about the solar system
